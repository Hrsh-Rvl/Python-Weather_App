# Python-Weather_App
Python Weather APP Project

This is a simple Python project to fetch weather details for a city using openweathermap.org API.

See requirement.txt file packages necessary to run the code.

You will need to create an account on openweathermap.org and get your own API key to run the code.

The project is from the tutorial posted by Bro Code on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4377DH5Jso
